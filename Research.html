                <p>Research on Body Ownership Illusion Toward Humanoid Robot<br></p>
                <p2>Through advances in recent technologies, we can make users to feel an illusory feeling of body
                    ownership toward humanoid robot at the remote places. Such asymmetric tele-embodiment system has the
                    power to elicit presence (toward remote distance a.k.a. locale), social interaction, and emotional
                    change between visitor and locale. Our research would be a game changer for the tele-communication
                    in the post-corona era (e.g. general purpose telecommunication, untact interview, untact
                    psychological counsel). Researches may extend to verify the actual therapeutic effect under current
                    circumstances.<br><br></p2>

                <p>Research on Human-AI interaction<br></p>
                <p2>With development of deep learning technologies, we are conducting research on Human-AI. In our
                    study, we are collecting and analyzing mobility data for people with handicaps. Our result suggest
                    that our deep learning model had high accuracy for detecting transportation modes for people with
                    handicaps. Based on the current study, we will suggest better Human-AI interaction to help people
                    with handicaps.<br><br></p2>

                <p2>We also conducting research on Human-Vehicle Interaction for future Autonomous Vehicles. In on of
                    our study, we consider Takeover Request (ToR) in Level 3 Autonomous Vehicle and takeover
                    performances according to environment factors such as weather or illumination. Our results suggested
                    that the environmental factor effected on user’s takeover performances in Level 3 Autonomous
                    Vehicle, and the proposed directional cue can reduce the effects of environmental factor.<br><br>

                <p>Research on VR Sickness<br></p>
                <p2>Although the virtual reality (VR) market is extremely large, the VR sickness is one of the big
                    problems. The VR sickness had a symptom similar with motion sickness experienced when experiencing
                    VR, including headache, nausea, and dizziness., In one of our study, we proposed a method to dynamic
                    blurring field of view (FOV) restrictor based on the relationship between FOV and VR sickness. We
                    studied the effect of several factors on VR sickness when applied as dynamic parameters. As a
                    result, dynamic blurring FOV restrictor had the effect of reducing VR sickness, and it had the best
                    performance when we apply certain level of appropriate human factors.<br><br></p2>

                <p>Research on Full-Body Ownership Illusion<br></p>
                <p2>​Recent advances in technology have allowed users to experience an illusory feeling of full body
                    ownership of a virtual avatar. Such virtual embodiment has the power to elicit perceptual,
                    behavioral, cognitive, and emotional changes related to oneself. Our research would be an important
                    foundation for new collaborations with virtual avatars or humanoid robots. For example,
                    collaborative therapeutic techniques and scenarios with other artificial surrogates would be
                    considered based on the paradigm of a virtually embodied self. Researches may extend interaction
                    domains from the individuals to the virtual avatars in an artificial world or tele-operations of
                    humanoid robots in real world.<br><br></p2>

                <p>Research on Human-Robot Interaction<br></p>
                <p2>Recent Studies on human-robot interactions have suggested that humanoid robots have considerable
                    potential in social cognition research. In the current study, we considerd two types of social
                    interaction tasks (initiating and responding inout attenntion tasks) and two types of interaction
                    partners (robot and human partners). The results of study suggested that participants who interacted
                    with a humanoid robots in social cognition studies and future research questions on human-robot
                    interactions.<br><br></p2>

                <p>Research on Human Field of Regard and Field of View<br></p>
                <p2>Human field of regard (FOR) is an important concept that should be considered along with field of
                    view (FOV) for people with/without handicaps, but previous studies have neglected this aspect of
                    human perception. In the current study, we suggest and test a new virtual reality (VR) software with
                    which to evaluate individual’s detection abilities in the human FOR. We suggested a new virtual
                    reality (VR) evaluation technique and measured the human searching pattern in the FOR condition. We
                    found a unique left-side attention bias in the FOR condition, and discussed implication of these
                    results and potential attention bias factors. We believe this work is an important foundation for
                    interactive 3D UI design, and we hope it will help people who have FOR handicaps.<br><br></p2>
